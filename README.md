# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview 
Help Beks to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be sucessful if funded by Alphabet Soup

## Results
###Data Preprocessing
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model? Target variable is the IS_SUCCESSFUL columns, that will show this analysis goal for if the loan is sucessful or not.
What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model? Features on our model are "APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT"
What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data? 'EIN' & 'NAME' columns are non-beneficial variable that dropped.

###Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
